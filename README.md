Hi There!
I'M HARSH JAIN


I am fluent in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C++ and have some experience with Python. Currently, I'm working on several projects in the MERN stack. I'm passionate about tackling challenging development work that I can be proud of.

In the near future, I plan to learn App Development, Django, PHP, and TypeScript to expand my skill set.

So far, I have solved over 150 LeetCode and 120 GeeksforGeeks (GFG) DSA problems. I'm constantly seeking opportunities to improve my programming and development skills.
